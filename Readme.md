# Core Idea
The frontend app that allows you to create, list, edit and delete task.

## Nota Bene
This is old test task specifically for the frontent. It requires the backend also, but generally provides the idea about code quality.

## Setup
1. run `npm install` in the terminal
2. Set up the **REACT_APP_BASE_URL** variable in .env file. Either way it will use default one.
3. run `npm run start` in the terminal

### Remarks
I don't like using 3d party libraries in general if they are big and heavy. It all, of course, depends on the business needs, timelines and easy of use. And our tech needs. But here I wanted to create custom table since it's a bit challenge to remind for myself. Added Typescript so we have strong typization.
